# RPM
    > Redhat package manager.  
    > The Red Hat Linux distribution is specially used to manage the programs of various Linux packages. 
    > Because it follows the GPL rules and is powerful and convenient, it is very popular. 
    > It is gradually adopted by other distributions. The emergence of RPM package management makes Linux 
    > easy to install and upgrade, which indirectly improves the applicability of Linux.
