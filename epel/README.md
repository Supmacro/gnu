# What is Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (or EPEL)?
    > Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (or EPEL) is a Fedora Special Interest Group that creates, 
    > maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, 
    > but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), 
    > Oracle Linux (OL).

    > EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or 
    > replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions. EPEL uses much of the same infrastructure 
    > as Fedora, including buildsystem, bugzilla instance, updates manager, mirror manager and more.
